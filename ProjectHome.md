I wrote this alarm clock for myself. Maybe others would like to use it.

I wanted an alarm clock that:
  * has a simple user interface
  * I can press anywhere on the screen to stop the alarm
  * No snooze feature
  * Power Nap feature
  * Able to set recurring alarms for days of the week.

The application has been tested on my phone. I don't guarantee that it works on
your phone.
